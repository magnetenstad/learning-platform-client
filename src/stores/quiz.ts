  'Identify the loop-invariant code in the following program fragment, and explain the benefit of moving it',
  'In C, sqrt is an external library function, whereas in FORTRAN, it is an intrinsic operation defined by the language. Briefly explain which difference this makes to an optimizing compiler when analyzing a loop like the following one',
  'Some languages feature a WHERE construct, which applies operations to arrays only where the elements meet a condition, e.g. if "a" is the array [1,2,3,4], the statement WHERE ( a < 3 ) a = a * 5 will result in the array [5,10,3,4].
